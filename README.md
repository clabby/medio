# Medio

A media player written in [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) based off of [electron](http://electron.atom.io/) and [react](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

## Notes
* This project was to learn react and electron. Don't expect this to be production-worthy at all.

## Contributing
To contribute, clone the repository and run `npm install && npm run dev`
